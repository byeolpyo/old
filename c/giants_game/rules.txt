"Giants" is a simple gambling game invented by my friend. It is played by any amount of players and a casino player.
The rules are very simple: 
- All players bet some amount of money.
- All players roll two six-side dices, while the casino player rolls one twelve-side dice.
- If the sum of rolls done by the player exceeds the roll of the casino, the player loses.
- If the sum is less than or equal to that of the casino, the player wins, but may choose to roll again with a four-side dice.
- During a reroll, the player bets additional money equal to their previous bet, essentially doubling the stakes. (if they bet 50, they need to bet another 50, but get 2*100 = 200 if they win, and they make 100 of profit)
- Sum of all dices is again compared to the casino's roll.
- The casino cannot reroll.

Like most gambling games, this game needs to yield a negative outcome in the long run for the player compared to the casino.
This program was intended to empirically check whether that is the case. It also implements an interface to play the game in an "interactive" mode against the computer.
